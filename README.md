# Gameplay

## Your turn:
At first it's your turn, to **deal damage**:
- Fill the **border squares**, by **drag and dropping** one of the 3 structures (**the red ones**) that appear on the left side of the screen:
    - squares with the **same border color** belong to the same **structure**.
    - When you **complete a structure** you gain **points** and **time**.
        - You get **1 point** for every square in the completed structure.
        - You gain **5 additional seconds** for structure you finish.
    - When your **time runs out** you automatically attack. The **strenght of your attack** equal the number of **points** you collected!

## Enemy's turn:
The enemy launches **obstacles** (like flappy bird) on top of you:
- Obstacles will take random amount of time (1.5 - 5 seconds) to move across the board.
- You control the **heart** (the player) by **moving your mouse** over the game.
- To avoid taking damage you have to move throught the gaps in the obstacles!

## WinAndLose
- To win reduce enemy's health to 0.
    - after winning you can replay the battle. On the **right side** of the screen, you can see how many enemy's you had defeated.
- You lose if your health reaches 0.
    - after losing, the only way to play again is to **refresh the website**.
